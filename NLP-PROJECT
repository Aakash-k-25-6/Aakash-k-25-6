Movies play an important part in everyoneâ€™s life. We can say that many movies have partly modeled us to what we are today. 
One of the ways in which movies are classified is by their genres. 
And those genres were formulated by the movie makers themselves. 
But practically no movies will have the same texture and completely have the same type. 
There can be various genres that a movie falls under. But we generalize it by choosing the major genre. 
And one of the major problems these days is tagging other movies which fall under similar kinds of storyline or share the same genre, it has been manually tagged.
What our project is all about is that we do a semantic analysis of the movie based on which we say formulate a movie into various sets of genres which the movie falls under
which can be later used to tag other movies of the same type. 
This can also be used to view genre classification of a movie and then decide whether to watch it or it is in-line with our taste.
